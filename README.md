Binary trees and polymorphism, what could be more fun?

I fancied trying out some fancy stuff like design patterns, polymorphism and binary trees. 
I also wanted to start working towards a long held dream of mine - making a computer do algebra for me.

Also, TDD is good so there are lots of tests.

Credit where it's due, this article helped a lot: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/evaluation-of-interpreter.expressiontree-tree/

I built an angular front end for interacting with this - https://algebro.netlify.app/calculator
